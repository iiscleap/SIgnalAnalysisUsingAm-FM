The folder contains matlab files for using FDLP decomposition operated on 32 QMF bands with a analysis window of 1s. 
The code allows to resynthesize with carrier or envelope information alone. With envelope information alone the re-synthesized signal sounds whispered. With the carrier part alone, the synthesized signal sounds message less. Interstingly, the amount of speechiness in the output can be controlled by the model order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Main Function 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code_decode_new.m - Performs QMF analysis, FDLP decomposition, Processing, QMF resynthesis.

To run the code, Matlab signal processing toolbox is needed.

How to run in matlab -

[A,Fs]= wavread('clean.wav');
figure; plot(A);
C_res = code_decode_new(A,Fs,30,1,0);
figure; plot(C_res);

The output can be saved using wavwrite and listenned to.
Also one can use revb.wav to analyze the effect of reverberation in FDLP modelling.

			Sub-functions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QMF_7_analysis_W_bark_mod.m ---
Function to perform the QMF analysis with low delay and with sharp transistion bandwidth. Output contains a cell array with size (7,64) with outputs from each stage in a 6 stage binary decomposition into 64 bands. Appropiate bands can be chosen to obtain 32 bands which are non-uniform.

analysis_fdlp_burg.m --- 
Function to perform the  Auto-regressive modelling of Hilbert Envelopes. The modelling is done by computing the analytic signal for the given input signal. The analytic signal is given as input to Yule-Walker spectral estimation technique which outputs the AR estimate of the HIlbert Envelope of the signal. 

QMF_7_synthesis_W_bark_mod.m ---
Sub-band synthesis to obtain the fullband signal from the sub-bands.
